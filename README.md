# Literature_Review_ML

This repository contains all the code for the work produced in the MAT3036 Literature Review module at the University of Surrey, Department of Mathematics. 

All code is written up in PyTorch.

The book *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems* serves as the basis for this literature review.
