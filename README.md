# Literature_Review_ML

This work is apart of the MAT3036 Literature Review module at the University of Surrey, Department of Mathematics. 

This repository contains the code used for all experiments in the ML Literature Review.

All code is written up in PyTorch.

The book *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems* serves as the basis for this literature review.
